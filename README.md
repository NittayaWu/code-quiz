# code-quiz

## Description:
This application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a Web API coding quiz. The intention of this application was to apply skills learned in JavaScript to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. This program puts to use JavaScript methods learned in class to dynamically create, append and set attributes to elements; setInterval() and clearInterval(); the use of events such as  eventListeners; the method to store data in the user's browser using localStorage; and converting an object to and from a JSON string by applying JSON methods. 


## Execution: 

To use this coding quiz application, the user is on the Coding quiz Challenge page, they should see a paragraph stating, "Try to answer the following code-related questions within the time limit. Keep in mind that incorrect answers will penalize your score/time by ten seconds!" The user should click on the "Start Quiz" button on the page. Once clicked, a countdown timer with a beginning time of 80 seconds and a set of questions appears. Once the user reads the questions and selects from the following options of answers, they will be notified if their selection was correct or incorrect. They are then presented the next question and choices of answers continously until they reach the end of the quiz. At the end of the quiz they are presented with the number of questions they got correct out of the available questions, a final score, which is the time remaining on the timer, and an input form to enter and submit their initials. Once the submit button is clicked, they are lead to the high scores page where they can view their saved score besides their initials. They then have the button options of clearing the high score list, or to go back to the Coding Quiz page.
